# Deep Reinforcement Learning
Implementing and showcasing reinforcement learning algorithms with deep networks. Following [Open AI spinning up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/keypapers.html) suggestions.

## Contents
### Deep Q learning and its variants

1. Deep Q learning
2. Deep Recurrent Q learning
2. Double Deep Q learning
3. Dueling Deep Q learning
4. Dueling Double Deep Q learning
5. Prioritized Experience Replay


### Policy Gradient Methods

1. Asynchronus Actor Critic
2. Trust Region Policy Optimization
3. GAE
4. Soft Actor Critic

## Status
For now only Deep Q learning notebook has some code explanations. Other notebooks are only code for the time being. I will keep adding texts explaning the methods used there.

## Todo
1. Add texts explaining the inner workings of the codes.
2. Solve other environments like cartpole and atari 2600.
3. Use CNNs
