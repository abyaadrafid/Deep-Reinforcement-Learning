# Deep Reinforcement Learning
Implementing and showcasing reinforcement learning algorithms with deep networks.

## Contents
### Lunar Lander Environment with Linear network
1. Deep Q learning with experience replay and fixed Q targets
2. Double Deep Q learning
3. Dueling Deep Q learning
4. Dueling Double Deep Q learning

## Status
For now only Deep Q learning notebook has some code explanations. Other notebooks are only code for the time being. I will keep adding texts explaning the methods used there.
