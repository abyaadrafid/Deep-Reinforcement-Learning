# Deep Reinforcement Learning
Implementing and showcasing reinforcement learning algorithms with deep networks.

## Contents
### Deep Q learning and its variants
For I have taken the lunarlander environment as a toy problem to solve.

1. Deep Q learning
2. Double Deep Q learning
3. Dueling Deep Q learning
4. Dueling Double Deep Q learning
5. Prioritized Experience Replay

## Status
For now only Deep Q learning notebook has some code explanations. Other notebooks are only code for the time being. I will keep adding texts explaning the methods used there.

## Todo
1. Add texts explaining the inner workings of the codes.
2. Solve other environments like cartpole and atari 2600.
3. Use CNNs
